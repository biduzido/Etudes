# Ã‰tudes

This is the repository where I keep the things I do while playing around and/or studying some technology, methodology, programming language and so on.
Some folders contains a submodule to another repository. Currently all of them are hosted on Github itself.

## Folder structure

It's rather lousy as of now... I try to create one folder for each general subject and inside them I put the submodules containing my codes. One noted example is the TDD folder, that it's a repository itself. It may change on the future, however.

## Contributing

This is more of a playground of mine but if you'd like to contribute or discuss something, feel free to open an issue or e-mail me!
