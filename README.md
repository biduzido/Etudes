# Ã‰tudes

Repository where I keep links to every other repository I have for playing around and/or studying some technology, methodology, programming language and so on.
By default every folder with actual content is a submodule to another repository. Currently all of them are hosted on Github itself.

## Folder structure

It's rather lousy as of now... I try to create one folder for each general subject and inside them I put the submodules containing my codes. One noted example is the TDD folder, that it's a repository itself. It may change on the future, however.

## Contributing

Well this is more of a personal repository but if you'd like to contribute or discuss something, feel free to open an issue!

## Licensing

Well I doubt that anything here will be licensed in any other license than MIT but please check from each repository its specific license
